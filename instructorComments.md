INSTRUCTOR COMMENTS
===================

This is a great example of a clean, efficient game of
Craps, and you did a good job of implementing the
default Y/N feature as indicated in the assignment. 

It was missing some key elements: there was no option
to see the instructions for the game, and there was
no indication during play that the first roll was
your "point", and that you were trying to match your
point. This program might work for someone who knows
the game of Craps well, but a little bit more of a
status indication ("Your point is 6," etc.) would make
it much better.

I see that you wrote a Dice.java class but ended up not
doing anything with it. Was that because you couldn't
get it to work, or you just decided to abandon the idea?
One of the nice things about GitHub is that you can just
delete the "abandon-ware" parts of project from your
current commit if they're no longer needed. You can always
go back and restore that code if it turns out you want
it after all.

You do enough work developing that you should totally
be using git for your projects! :)

Good work on this, overall, with just a few missing
components. Any reason it was late?

SCORE: 45/50
